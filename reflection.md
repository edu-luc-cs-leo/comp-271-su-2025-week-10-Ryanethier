# Final Code Reflection

Reviewing my recursive solutions alongside my professor’s, I noticed several key differences that helped me reflect on both my growth and areas for improvement. 

For example, in my `findMax` method, I implemented a divide-and-conquer approach similar to your `findMax2`, but I lacked the initial base case for when `left == right`, which could lead to errors. 

My version of `reverseArray` was nearly identical in structure and logic, which reassured me that I’m grasping recursive swapping. 

For `countOccurrences`, my logic was functionally correct, but I didn’t include comments or the base case clarity that you demonstrated. 

Lastly, my `binarySearch` followed the proper recursive pattern, though your version includes more robust bounds checking and clearer documentation. 

**Overall**, comparing my work to the solutions helped me understand how to write cleaner code, use more precise base cases, and structure my logic in a clearer, more maintainable way.
